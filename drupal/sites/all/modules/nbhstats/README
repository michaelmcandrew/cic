Creates a link to http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk for each address in CiviCRM with a postcode.

Links are updated each time a contact is created or updated.  This module also includes a batch process (http://yourdomain.org/civicrm/nbhstats/batch) to update all addresses after installation.

See INSTALLATION.txt for installation instructions.
